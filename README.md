# Student-Report
1. Title- Student Enrollment and Revenue Dashboard in Power BI
This project presents a visually rich and interactive dashboard built using Power BI to analyze student enrollment patterns, course-wise fee collections,
certificate issuance, and demographic trends

2. Short Description / Purpose
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of student enrollments, course-wise revenue, certificate issuance, and demographic insights. The purpose
is to help training institutes monitor performance, identify high-revenue courses, track monthly trends, and understand student age distribution to make
decisions

3. Tech Stack
Power BI (Primary Tool)
Data Import & Transformation: Used Power BIâ€™s Power Query Editor to import and clean the dataset. Basic data wrangling was performed to shape the data for
analysis
Data Modeling: Relationships were created between tables (if any), and data types were properly defined to ensure accurate aggregations
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): DAX was used for calculated fields and measures such as total fees, certificate counts, and dynamic labels
Visualizations: A range of visual elements including KPI cards, bar charts, gauge charts, column charts, and donut charts were used to make insights intuitive and interactive
Slicers and Filters: Dropdown filters (for Year, City, and Course) were added to enable dynamic filtering and easy data exploration by end-users

4. Data
The dataset contains details on student enrollments, course fees, certificate issuance status, age distribution, and registration dates. It simulates real
world data commonly used by educational institutions to manage and analyze training programs. The data was used solely for dashboard development and learning
purposes.

5. Features/Highlights
Business Problem: Education providers need insights into enrollments, revenue, and certifications to make data-driven decisions
Goal: To visualize key metrics like total students, revenue, certificate status, and demographic trends
Dashboard Overview: Shows KPIs, course-wise revenue, monthly enrollments, age distribution, and certificate issuance
Insights: Identifies high-revenue courses, peak enrollment months, and key student age groups for better planning
